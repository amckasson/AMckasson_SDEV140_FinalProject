Health Application User Manual

	Welcome to the Health Application Python GUI.  This application was created to help track a user’s daily workout.  The secondary function of the application is to motivate users by keeping a report of all workouts done and inputted, so that a user may track their progress through a text file generated using one of the buttons (Save).  It’s straightforward and easy to use.  Below you will find how to work the application.
	First the application needs to be opened to run.  Simply click the file or if viewing the code open something like “Python Idol” and run the program.  You will then be led to the GUI.
	The user will know they’re in the application when the window pops up with the title Health Tracker.  Below the user will see five input options.  For the program to generate results all five input options will need to have the appropriate data to continue.  
 
-	Enter your Name:  This is the first input field and requires the user to put in any name for the health application.  It can be the primary users name or a secondary user.
-	Enter the Date: User is to enter the date here, it expects a string input so any collection of characters will work.
-	Enter your Weight: this is where the user will enter their weight.  The input expects an integer input.  If a non-integer is put into this input an error will generate when running the report indicating that the user has input incorrect information into the application.  At which point the user will be returned to the main window of the GUI.
-	Enter the Calories that you Burned Today: This input requires an integer input that represents how many calories the user burned during the workout.  If a non-integer is put into this input an error will generate when running the report indicating that the user has input incorrect information into the application.  At which point the user will be returned to the main window of the GUI.
-	Enter your Daily Calorie Goal: This input requires an integer input that represents the user’s goal of calories burned for the workout.  If a non-integer is put into this input an error will generate when running the report indicating that the user has input incorrect information into the application.  At which point the user will be returned to the main window of the GUI.
-	Enter the Workouts that you did Today: Finally, this input expects an explanation of the workout you did today.  Examples include but are not limited to “Running”, “Walking”, “Biking”, “Weightlifting” etc.  This is not a strict input in that it only requires a string entry, though there is a limit in characters that can be entered.



The user will find buttons that perform various actions for the application, the description of each is as follows:
-	Daily Report: The daily report will generate in a new window; this is a rundown of all the information the user entered for the daily workout.  It includes the users name, date, weight, calories burned today, the calorie goal, the workouts done, and how many calories the user has remained to burn to hit their goal.  If a user has passed their calorie goal it will display how many extra calories were burned in the form of a negative integer.  If the user entered incorrect information into the entries, a pop up will come up stating so, and give some suggestions on what may have gone wrong.
-	Clear: The clear button simply clears the user entries.  Be warned if the user did not save the information, it will be lost when pushing the clear button.
-	Save: This button was designed to save the user workouts in a text file.  The file will be automatically created in the same file as the application when pressed. 
-	Exit:  The “Exit” button will close the application.  The user may also close the application by clicking the "x" at the top left of the window.

Thank you for using the “Health Tracker” GUI application.  I hope it was an easy-to-use application that you can get some use out of.  Good luck in all your health pursuits!
I’m the only contributor to the project.  There may be updates in the future.  At this time there’s no public option to reach me for the project.
